Checking and enabling SELinux in CentOS/RHEL
Prerequisites: 
  1. Sudo privilege
  
SELinux Modes: 
  SELinux runs into three modes - 
  1. Enforcing mode: This is the default mode. It blocks and logs actions that are against defined policy.
  2. Permissive mode: Allows actions to take place and logs the events in detail. This mode is useful when testing SELinux features. Changing modes between      enforcing and permissive does not require a system reboot.
  3. Disabled mode: Allows for all actions and does not log any activity. Changing to this mode requires a system reboot for it to apply. Learn more on          disabling SELinux.
  
  How to check the status of SELinux:
  Login to your machine and run the following command in terminal.
  
  sestatus
  
  [root@bosdevxininf01 ~]# sestatus
  SELinux status:                 disabled
  
How to Enable SELinux:

sudo vi  /etc/selinux/config

Update the line - 
SELINUX=disabled

You can set it to permissive or enforcing. Save the file and exit. Reboot the machine for the change to take effect.

sudo reboot


To change the mode from enforcing to permissive type:

sudo setenforce 0

To turn the enforcing mode back on, enter:

sudo setenforce 1


Changing the node from permissive to enforcing or viceversa doesn't require a reboot.
